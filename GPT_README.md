## 1. Core Python Concepts for DevOps Scripting

Python's simplicity and readability make it an ideal language for DevOps scripting. Even with basic Python knowledge, understanding a few core concepts more deeply will significantly enhance your ability to write robust and efficient scripts for automation.

### Variables and Data Types

Variables are fundamental to any programming language, serving as containers for storing data values. In Python, you don't need to declare the type of a variable; the interpreter infers it at runtime. Understanding common data types is crucial for handling different kinds of information in your DevOps scripts.

*   **Strings (`str`):** Used for textual data, such as file paths, log messages, or configuration values. Strings are immutable, meaning their content cannot be changed after creation.

    ```python
    file_path = "/var/log/syslog"
    service_name = "nginx"
    print(f"Analyzing logs from: {file_path}")
    ```

*   **Integers (`int`):** Represent whole numbers, often used for counts, process IDs, or port numbers.

    ```python
    max_retries = 5
    port = 8080
    print(f"Attempting connection on port: {port}")
    ```

*   **Floats (`float`):** Represent real numbers with decimal points, useful for metrics or performance data.

    ```python
    cpu_utilization = 85.75
    disk_free_gb = 123.45
    ```

*   **Booleans (`bool`):** Represent truth values (`True` or `False`), essential for conditional logic and flags.

    ```python
    is_production = True
    service_running = False
    if is_production:
        print("Running in production environment.")
    ```

*   **Lists (`list`):** Ordered, mutable collections of items. Ideal for storing sequences of data, like a list of servers, users, or files.

    ```python
    servers = ["webserver01", "dbserver01", "appserver01"]
    users_to_add = ["john.doe", "jane.smith"]
    print(f"First server: {servers[0]}")
    ```

*   **Dictionaries (`dict`):** Unordered, mutable collections of key-value pairs. Perfect for representing structured data, such as configuration settings, API responses, or resource properties.

    ```python
    config = {
        "database_host": "localhost",
        "database_port": 5432,
        "database_user": "admin"
    }
    instance_details = {
        "id": "i-1234567890abcdef0",
        "type": "t2.micro",
        "state": "running"
    }
    print(f"Database host: {config['database_host']}")
    ```

### Control Flow

Control flow statements dictate the order in which instructions are executed, allowing your scripts to make decisions and repeat actions. This is crucial for creating dynamic and responsive DevOps automation.

*   **Conditional Statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`):** Execute different blocks of code based on whether certain conditions are met. This is fundamental for handling various scenarios in your scripts.

    ```python
    status_code = 200
    if status_code == 200:
        print("Operation successful.")
    elif status_code == 404:
        print("Resource not found.")
    else:
        print(f"An error occurred: {status_code}")

    environment = "dev"
    if environment == "prod":
        print("Deploying to production - proceed with caution!")
    elif environment == "staging":
        print("Deploying to staging.")
    else:
        print("Deploying to development.")
    ```

*   **Loops (`for`, `while`):** Allow you to execute a block of code repeatedly. Loops are indispensable for iterating over lists of items, processing files, or retrying operations.

    *   **`for` loop:** Iterates over a sequence (like a list, tuple, dictionary, or string) or other iterable objects.

        ```python
        servers = ["web01", "web02", "db01"]
        for server in servers:
            print(f"Processing server: {server}")

        # Iterating with index
        for i, server in enumerate(servers):
            print(f"Server {i+1}: {server}")

        # Looping through dictionary items
        user_data = {"name": "Alice", "role": "admin"}
        for key, value in user_data.items():
            print(f"{key}: {value}")
        ```

    *   **`while` loop:** Executes a block of code as long as a condition is true. Useful for scenarios requiring repeated execution until a specific state is reached, such as waiting for a service to start.

        ```python
        import time

        attempts = 0
        max_attempts = 5
        service_ready = False

        while not service_ready and attempts < max_attempts:
            print(f"Attempt {attempts + 1} to check service status...")
            # Simulate checking service status
            if attempts == 2:
                service_ready = True
            else:
                time.sleep(1) # Wait for 1 second
            attempts += 1

        if service_ready:
            print("Service is ready!")
        else:
            print("Service did not become ready after multiple attempts.")
        ```

### Functions

Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task. They are crucial for organizing your scripts, promoting code reusability, and making your automation more maintainable and readable. Defining functions allows you to break down complex problems into smaller, manageable pieces.

```python
def create_user(username, password, groups=None):
    """Creates a new user with specified username, password, and optional groups."""
    print(f"Creating user: {username}")
    # In a real script, this would interact with OS or directory service
    if groups:
        print(f"Adding {username} to groups: {', '.join(groups)}")
    print("User created successfully.")

def deploy_application(app_name, version, target_server):
    """Deploys a specific version of an application to a target server."""
    print(f"Deploying {app_name} v{version} to {target_server}...")
    # Logic for deployment (e.g., copy files, restart service)
    print("Deployment complete.")

# Calling the functions
create_user("devops_user", "SecureP@ssw0rd", groups=["sudo", "developers"])
deploy_application("webapp", "1.0.0", "webserver01")
```

### Error Handling

Robust DevOps scripts must anticipate and gracefully handle errors. Unexpected issues, such as network outages, file not found errors, or API failures, can disrupt automation. Python's `try-except` blocks provide a powerful mechanism for managing these situations, preventing your scripts from crashing and allowing for recovery or informative error messages.

*   **`try` and `except`:** The `try` block contains code that might raise an exception. If an exception occurs, the code in the `except` block is executed. You can specify different `except` blocks for different types of exceptions.

    ```python
    import os

    file_name = "non_existent_file.txt"
    try:
        with open(file_name, 'r') as f:
            content = f.read()
        print(f"File content: {content}")
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print(f"Error: The file '{file_name}' was not found.")
    except PermissionError:
        print(f"Error: Permission denied to access '{file_name}'.")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")

    # Example with network operation
    import requests

    try:
        response = requests.get("http://nonexistent-domain.com", timeout=5)
        response.raise_for_status() # Raises HTTPError for bad responses (4xx or 5xx)
        print(f"Successfully connected to API. Status: {response.status_code}")
    except requests.exceptions.ConnectionError as e:
        print(f"Network error: Could not connect to the API. {e}")
    except requests.exceptions.Timeout as e:
        print(f"Timeout error: API did not respond in time. {e}")
    except requests.exceptions.HTTPError as e:
        print(f"HTTP error: {e.response.status_code} - {e.response.reason}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An unexpected error occurred during API call: {e}")
    ```

*   **`finally`:** The `finally` block is always executed, regardless of whether an exception occurred or not. This is useful for cleanup operations, such as closing files or releasing resources.

    ```python
    file_descriptor = None
    try:
        file_descriptor = open("my_log.txt", "w")
        file_descriptor.write("This is a log entry.")
    except IOError as e:
        print(f"Error writing to file: {e}")
    finally:
        if file_descriptor:
            file_descriptor.close()
            print("File closed in finally block.")
    ```

*   **`raise`:** You can explicitly raise exceptions using the `raise` statement. This is useful for signaling specific error conditions within your own functions or modules.

    ```python
    def validate_config(config_data):
        if "api_key" not in config_data:
            raise ValueError("API key is missing from configuration.")
        if not isinstance(config_data["timeout"], int) or config_data["timeout"] <= 0:
            raise TypeError("Timeout must be a positive integer.")
        print("Configuration validated successfully.")

    try:
        # validate_config({"timeout": 10})
        validate_config({"api_key": "abc", "timeout": "invalid"})
    except ValueError as e:
        print(f"Configuration error: {e}")
    except TypeError as e:
        print(f"Configuration type error: {e}")
    ```

Mastering these core Python concepts provides a solid foundation for building reliable and efficient DevOps scripts. The next section will delve into specific Python libraries that are indispensable for common DevOps tasks.




## 2. Key Python Libraries for DevOps Tasks

Python's rich ecosystem of libraries is a major reason for its popularity in DevOps. These libraries abstract away much of the complexity of interacting with operating systems, networks, and cloud providers, allowing you to focus on the automation logic. This section highlights essential libraries for various DevOps tasks.

### OS Interaction: `os`, `subprocess`, `shutil`

Interacting with the underlying operating system is a common requirement in DevOps scripts. Python provides powerful built-in modules for this purpose.

*   **`os` module:** Provides a way of using operating system dependent functionality. It allows you to interact with the file system, environment variables, and execute shell commands.

    ```python
    import os

    # Get current working directory
    current_dir = os.getcwd()
    print(f"Current directory: {current_dir}")

    # List contents of a directory
    print("Files in current directory:")
    for item in os.listdir(current_dir):
        print(f"- {item}")

    # Create a new directory
    new_dir = "./my_temp_dir"
    if not os.path.exists(new_dir):
        os.makedirs(new_dir)
        print(f"Created directory: {new_dir}")

    # Get environment variables
    path_env = os.getenv("PATH")
    print(f"PATH environment variable: {path_env[:50]}...") # Print first 50 chars

    # Execute a simple shell command (less preferred for complex commands)
    # os.system("echo Hello from os.system")
    ```

*   **`subprocess` module:** This is the recommended way to run external commands and interact with their input/output streams. It offers more control and flexibility than `os.system()`.

    ```python
    import subprocess

    # Run a simple command and capture output
    try:
        result = subprocess.run(["ls", "-l"], capture_output=True, text=True, check=True)
        print("\nOutput of 'ls -l':")
        print(result.stdout)
    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
        print(f"Error executing command: {e}")
        print(f"Stderr: {e.stderr}")

    # Run a command with arguments and check return code
    try:
        # This command will fail if 'non_existent_command' doesn't exist
        subprocess.run(["non_existent_command"], check=True)
        print("Command executed successfully.")
    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
        print(f"Command failed with exit code {e.returncode}")

    # Running a command in the background (Popen)
    # process = subprocess.Popen(["ping", "8.8.8.8"], stdout=subprocess.PIPE)
    # print("Ping process started in background.")
    # # You can read output or wait for it later
    # # output, errors = process.communicate()
    # # print(output.decode())
    ```

*   **`shutil` module:** Provides high-level file operations, making it easier to copy, move, and delete files and directories.

    ```python
    import shutil
    import os

    # Create dummy files and directories for demonstration
    if not os.path.exists("source_dir"): os.makedirs("source_dir")
    with open("source_dir/file1.txt", "w") as f: f.write("Content of file1")
    with open("source_dir/file2.txt", "w") as f: f.write("Content of file2")

    # Copy a file
    shutil.copy("source_dir/file1.txt", "./copied_file1.txt")
    print("Copied file1.txt to copied_file1.txt")

    # Copy a directory (recursively)
    if os.path.exists("destination_dir"): shutil.rmtree("destination_dir")
    shutil.copytree("source_dir", "destination_dir")
    print("Copied source_dir to destination_dir")

    # Move a file (can also rename)
    shutil.move("copied_file1.txt", "./moved_file1.txt")
    print("Moved copied_file1.txt to moved_file1.txt")

    # Remove a directory and its contents
    shutil.rmtree("source_dir")
    print("Removed source_dir")
    shutil.rmtree("destination_dir")
    print("Removed destination_dir")
    os.remove("moved_file1.txt")
    print("Removed moved_file1.txt")
    ```

### File and Directory Manipulation

While `os` and `shutil` cover many aspects, direct file and directory manipulation often involves more specific tasks like path joining, checking existence, and iterating through files. Python's built-in capabilities and the `pathlib` module simplify these operations.

*   **`pathlib` module (Python 3.4+):** Offers an object-oriented approach to file system paths, making path manipulation more intuitive and less error-prone than string-based methods.

    ```python
    from pathlib import Path

    # Define a path
    current_path = Path.cwd()
    print(f"Current path (Pathlib): {current_path}")

    # Joining paths
    log_file_path = current_path / "logs" / "app.log"
    print(f"Log file path: {log_file_path}")

    # Check if path exists and is a file/directory
    if log_file_path.exists():
        print(f"{log_file_path} exists.")
        if log_file_path.is_file():
            print(f"{log_file_path} is a file.")
        elif log_file_path.is_dir():
            print(f"{log_file_path} is a directory.")
    else:
        print(f"{log_file_path} does not exist. Creating dummy file...")
        log_file_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True) # Create parent dirs if needed
        log_file_path.touch() # Create an empty file

    # Iterate through files in a directory
    print("\nFiles in current directory (using glob):")
    for f in current_path.glob("*.py"): # Find all Python files
        print(f"- {f.name}")

    # Read/write file content directly
    temp_file = Path("temp_config.txt")
    temp_file.write_text("setting=value\nmode=production")
    print(f"\nContent of {temp_file.name}:\n{temp_file.read_text()}")
    temp_file.unlink() # Delete the file
    ```

### JSON/YAML Parsing for Configuration Files

Configuration files are central to DevOps, often stored in JSON or YAML formats. Python has excellent built-in support for JSON and popular third-party libraries for YAML, making it easy to read, modify, and write configuration.

*   **`json` module (built-in):** For working with JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) data.

    ```python
    import json

    # Example JSON string
    json_data = 
    """
    {
        "application": {
            "name": "MyApp",
            "version": "1.0.0"
        },
        "database": {
            "host": "localhost",
            "port": 5432,
            "enabled": true
        },
        "services": ["auth", "payment"]
    }
    """

    # Parse JSON string to Python dictionary
    config = json.loads(json_data)
    print("\nParsed JSON config:")
    print(f"App Name: {config["application"]["name"]}")
    print(f"DB Port: {config["database"]["port"]}")
    print(f"Services: {config["services"]}")

    # Modify data
    config["database"]["port"] = 5433
    config["services"].append("logging")

    # Convert Python dictionary back to JSON string
    updated_json_data = json.dumps(config, indent=4) # indent for pretty printing
    print("\nUpdated JSON config:")
    print(updated_json_data)

    # Write to a JSON file
    with open("config.json", "w") as f:
        json.dump(config, f, indent=4)
    print("Config written to config.json")

    # Read from a JSON file
    with open("config.json", "r") as f:
        loaded_config = json.load(f)
    print(f"\nLoaded config from file: {loaded_config["application"]["version"]}")
    os.remove("config.json")
    ```

*   **`PyYAML` library (third-party):** For working with YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language) data. You'll need to install it (`pip install PyYAML`).

    ```python
    # You need to install PyYAML: pip install PyYAML
    import yaml
    import os

    # Example YAML string
    yaml_data = 
    """
    application:
      name: MyWebApp
      environment: development
    database:
      host: db.example.com
      user: devuser
      password: "${DB_PASSWORD}"
    servers:
      - web01
      - web02
    """

    # Parse YAML string to Python dictionary
    config_yaml = yaml.safe_load(yaml_data)
    print("\nParsed YAML config:")
    print(f"App Environment: {config_yaml["application"]["environment"]}")
    print(f"DB Host: {config_yaml["database"]["host"]}")

    # Modify data
    config_yaml["application"]["environment"] = "production"
    config_yaml["servers"].append("web03")

    # Convert Python dictionary back to YAML string
    updated_yaml_data = yaml.dump(config_yaml, indent=2)
    print("\nUpdated YAML config:")
    print(updated_yaml_data)

    # Write to a YAML file
    with open("config.yaml", "w") as f:
        yaml.dump(config_yaml, f, indent=2)
    print("Config written to config.yaml")

    # Read from a YAML file
    with open("config.yaml", "r") as f:
        loaded_config_yaml = yaml.safe_load(f)
    print(f"\nLoaded config from file: {loaded_config_yaml["servers"]}")
    os.remove("config.yaml")
    ```

### HTTP Requests: `requests`

Interacting with web services and APIs is a cornerstone of modern DevOps. The `requests` library is the de facto standard for making HTTP requests in Python, known for its simplicity and power. You'll need to install it (`pip install requests`).

```python
# You need to install requests: pip install requests
import requests

# GET request
print("\n--- GET Request Example ---")
try:
    response = requests.get("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1")
    response.raise_for_status() # Raise an exception for HTTP errors
    post_data = response.json()
    print(f"Status Code: {response.status_code}")
    print(f"Post Title: {post_data["title"]}")
except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
    print(f"Error during GET request: {e}")

# POST request
print("\n--- POST Request Example ---")
new_post = {
    "title": "foo",
    "body": "bar",
    "userId": 1
}
try:
    response = requests.post("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts", json=new_post)
    response.raise_for_status()
    created_post = response.json()
    print(f"Status Code: {response.status_code}")
    print(f"Created Post ID: {created_post["id"]}")
except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
    print(f"Error during POST request: {e}")

# Handling headers and authentication
print("\n--- Headers and Auth Example ---")
headers = {
    "User-Agent": "Python DevOps Script",
    "Accept": "application/json"
}
# For basic authentication:
# auth = ("username", "password")

try:
    # Example with a public API that might require headers
    response = requests.get("https://api.github.com/users/octocat", headers=headers)
    response.raise_for_status()
    github_user = response.json()
    print(f"GitHub User Name: {github_user["name"]}")
except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
    print(f"Error during authenticated request: {e}")

# Timeout and retries
print("\n--- Timeout Example ---")
try:
    # Set a timeout for the request (in seconds)
    response = requests.get("https://httpbin.org/delay/3", timeout=1)
    response.raise_for_status()
    print("Request completed within timeout.")
except requests.exceptions.Timeout:
    print("Request timed out after 1 second.")
except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
    print(f"Other request error: {e}")
```

### Cloud SDKs

Automating cloud infrastructure is a primary use case for Python in DevOps. Major cloud providers offer comprehensive Python SDKs (Software Development Kits) that allow you to programmatically interact with their services. These SDKs handle authentication, request signing, and API communication, simplifying cloud automation.

*   **`boto3` (AWS SDK for Python):** The official AWS SDK for Python, enabling interaction with Amazon Web Services like EC2, S3, Lambda, and more. You'll need to install it (`pip install boto3`).

    ```python
    # You need to install boto3: pip install boto3
    # Ensure your AWS credentials are configured (e.g., via AWS CLI, environment variables)
    import boto3

    print("\n--- AWS S3 Example (boto3) ---")
    try:
        # Create an S3 client
        s3 = boto3.client("s3")

        # List S3 buckets
        response = s3.list_buckets()
        print("Existing S3 Buckets:")
        if response["Buckets"]:
            for bucket in response["Buckets"]:
                print(f"- {bucket["Name"]}")
        else:
            print("No S3 buckets found.")

        # Example: Upload a file to S3 (requires a bucket and a local file)
        # bucket_name = "my-unique-devops-bucket-12345"
        # file_to_upload = "local_file.txt"
        # s3.upload_file(file_to_upload, bucket_name, "remote_file_key.txt")
        # print(f"Uploaded {file_to_upload} to s3://{bucket_name}/remote_file_key.txt")

    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error interacting with AWS S3: {e}")
    ```

*   **Azure SDK for Python:** A collection of libraries for interacting with Azure services. You'll install specific packages based on the service you need (e.g., `pip install azure-mgmt-compute` for VM management, `pip install azure-storage-blob` for Blob Storage).

    ```python
    # You need to install Azure SDK packages, e.g., pip install azure-identity azure-mgmt-compute
    # Ensure your Azure credentials are configured (e.g., via Azure CLI, environment variables)
    # from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
    # from azure.mgmt.compute import ComputeManagementClient

    print("\n--- Azure Compute Example (Azure SDK) ---")
    try:
        # This example requires Azure credentials and a subscription ID
        # credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
        # subscription_id = "YOUR_AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID"
        # compute_client = ComputeManagementClient(credential, subscription_id)

        # Example: List virtual machines in a resource group
        # resource_group_name = "myResourceGroup"
        # print(f"Virtual Machines in {resource_group_name}:")
        # for vm in compute_client.virtual_machines.list(resource_group_name):
        #     print(f"- {vm.name} ({vm.location})")
        print("Azure SDK example commented out. Uncomment and configure credentials to run.")

    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error interacting with Azure: {e}")
    ```

*   **Google Cloud SDK for Python:** Libraries for interacting with Google Cloud Platform services. Install specific packages (e.g., `pip install google-cloud-storage` for Cloud Storage, `pip install google-cloud-compute` for Compute Engine).

    ```python
    # You need to install Google Cloud SDK packages, e.g., pip install google-cloud-storage
    # Ensure your Google Cloud credentials are configured (e.g., via gcloud CLI, environment variables)
    # from google.cloud import storage

    print("\n--- Google Cloud Storage Example (Google Cloud SDK) ---")
    try:
        # This example requires Google Cloud credentials and a project ID
        # storage_client = storage.Client()

        # Example: List buckets in your project
        # print("Google Cloud Storage Buckets:")
        # for bucket in storage_client.list_buckets():
        #     print(f"- {bucket.name}")
        print("Google Cloud SDK example commented out. Uncomment and configure credentials to run.")

    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error interacting with Google Cloud: {e}")
    ```

These libraries form the backbone of Python-based DevOps automation, enabling scripts to interact with virtually any system or service. The next section will explore practical use cases where these concepts and libraries come together to solve real-world DevOps challenges.




## 3. Common DevOps Use Cases

Python's versatility makes it an excellent choice for automating a wide array of DevOps tasks. This section provides practical examples of how Python can be applied to common scenarios, demonstrating the power of the libraries discussed previously.

### Automating Infrastructure Provisioning/De-provisioning

Python, especially with cloud SDKs, can automate the creation, modification, and deletion of infrastructure resources. This is crucial for Infrastructure as Code (IaC) practices, enabling consistent and repeatable environments.

**Example: Provisioning an AWS S3 Bucket**

This script demonstrates how to create an S3 bucket if it doesn't exist and then clean it up. This is a simplified example; real-world provisioning often involves more complex resource configurations and error handling.

```python
import boto3
import logging

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format=
    '%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s'
)

def create_s3_bucket(bucket_name, region=
    'us-east-1'
):
    """Creates an S3 bucket in the specified region."""
    s3_client = boto3.client('s3', region_name=region)
    try:
        s3_client.create_bucket(
            Bucket=bucket_name,
            CreateBucketConfiguration={
                'LocationConstraint': region
            }
        )
        logging.info(f"Bucket '{bucket_name}' created successfully in {region}.")
    except s3_client.exceptions.BucketAlreadyOwnedByYou:
        logging.warning(f"Bucket '{bucket_name}' already exists and is owned by you.")
    except Exception as e:
        logging.error(f"Error creating bucket '{bucket_name}': {e}")
        return False
    return True

def delete_s3_bucket(bucket_name):
    """Deletes an S3 bucket after emptying it."""
    s3_resource = boto3.resource('s3')
    bucket = s3_resource.Bucket(bucket_name)
    try:
        # Delete all objects in the bucket first
        bucket.objects.all().delete()
        bucket.delete()
        logging.info(f"Bucket '{bucket_name}' and its contents deleted successfully.")
    except s3_resource.meta.client.exceptions.NoSuchBucket:
        logging.warning(f"Bucket '{bucket_name}' does not exist.")
    except Exception as e:
        logging.error(f"Error deleting bucket '{bucket_name}': {e}")
        return False
    return True

if __name__ == "__main__":
    BUCKET_NAME = "my-devops-provisioned-bucket-12345"
    AWS_REGION = "us-east-1"

    print(f"\n--- Attempting to provision S3 bucket: {BUCKET_NAME} ---")
    if create_s3_bucket(BUCKET_NAME, AWS_REGION):
        print("S3 bucket provisioning process completed.")

        # Simulate some operations or wait time
        import time
        time.sleep(5)

        print(f"\n--- Attempting to de-provision S3 bucket: {BUCKET_NAME} ---")
        if delete_s3_bucket(BUCKET_NAME):
            print("S3 bucket de-provisioning process completed.")
        else:
            print("S3 bucket de-provisioning failed.")
    else:
        print("S3 bucket provisioning failed.")
```

### Managing Cloud Resources

Beyond provisioning, Python scripts can manage the lifecycle of cloud resources, such as starting/stopping instances, updating configurations, or monitoring resource usage.

**Example: Start/Stop AWS EC2 Instances by Tag**

This script demonstrates how to find EC2 instances based on a specific tag and then start or stop them. This is useful for cost optimization (stopping non-production instances overnight) or environment management.

```python
import boto3
import logging

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format=
    '%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s'
)

def get_ec2_instances_by_tag(tag_key, tag_value, region=
    'us-east-1'
):
    """Retrieves EC2 instance IDs that have a specific tag."""
    ec2_client = boto3.client('ec2', region_name=region)
    instance_ids = []
    try:
        response = ec2_client.describe_instances(
            Filters=[
                {
                    'Name': f'tag:{tag_key}',
                    'Values': [tag_value]
                },
                {
                    'Name': 'instance-state-name',
                    'Values': ['running', 'stopped'] # Include both for management
                }
            ]
        )
        for reservation in response['Reservations']:
            for instance in reservation['Instances']:
                instance_ids.append(instance['InstanceId'])
    except Exception as e:
        logging.error(f"Error describing EC2 instances: {e}")
    return instance_ids

def start_ec2_instances(instance_ids, region=
    'us-east-1'
):
    """Starts a list of EC2 instances."""
    if not instance_ids: return
    ec2_client = boto3.client('ec2', region_name=region)
    try:
        ec2_client.start_instances(InstanceIds=instance_ids)
        logging.info(f"Started EC2 instances: {', '.join(instance_ids)}")
    except Exception as e:
        logging.error(f"Error starting EC2 instances {instance_ids}: {e}")

def stop_ec2_instances(instance_ids, region=
    'us-east-1'
):
    """Stops a list of EC2 instances."""
    if not instance_ids: return
    ec2_client = boto3.client('ec2', region_name=region)
    try:
        ec2_client.stop_instances(InstanceIds=instance_ids)
        logging.info(f"Stopped EC2 instances: {', '.join(instance_ids)}")
    except Exception as e:
        logging.error(f"Error stopping EC2 instances {instance_ids}: {e}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    TAG_KEY = "Environment"
    TAG_VALUE = "Dev"
    AWS_REGION = "us-east-1"

    print(f"\n--- Managing EC2 instances with Tag: {TAG_KEY}={TAG_VALUE} ---")
    dev_instances = get_ec2_instances_by_tag(TAG_KEY, TAG_VALUE, AWS_REGION)

    if dev_instances:
        print(f"Found Dev instances: {', '.join(dev_instances)}")
        action = input("Do you want to (s)tart or (t)op these instances? (s/t): ").lower()
        if action == 's':
            start_ec2_instances(dev_instances, AWS_REGION)
        elif action == 't':
            stop_ec2_instances(dev_instances, AWS_REGION)
        else:
            print("Invalid action. No operation performed.")
    else:
        print(f"No EC2 instances found with tag {TAG_KEY}={TAG_VALUE}.")
```

### CI/CD Pipeline Automation

Python can integrate with and automate various stages of a CI/CD pipeline, from triggering builds to deploying applications and updating status in project management tools.

**Example: Triggering a Jenkins Build via API**

This script uses the `requests` library to trigger a Jenkins job. This is a common pattern for integrating different tools in a DevOps workflow.

```python
import requests
import logging

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format=
    '%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s'
)

def trigger_jenkins_job(jenkins_url, job_name, username, api_token, params=None):
    """Triggers a Jenkins job with optional parameters."""
    build_url = f"{jenkins_url}/job/{job_name}/buildWithParameters"
    if not params: # Use build instead of buildWithParameters if no params
        build_url = f"{jenkins_url}/job/{job_name}/build"

    auth = (username, api_token)
    headers = {'Crumb': 'test'}
    # Jenkins requires a CSRF crumb for POST requests if CSRF protection is enabled.
    # For simplicity, we're skipping crumb fetching here, but in production, you'd fetch it:
    # crumb_url = f"{jenkins_url}/crumbIssuer/api/json"
    # crumb_response = requests.get(crumb_url, auth=auth)
    # if crumb_response.status_code == 200:
    #     crumb = crumb_response.json()
    #     headers = {crumb['crumbRequestField']: crumb['crumb']}

    try:
        response = requests.post(build_url, auth=auth, params=params, headers=headers)
        response.raise_for_status() # Raise an exception for HTTP errors
        logging.info(f"Jenkins job '{job_name}' triggered successfully. Status: {response.status_code}")
        return True
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        logging.error(f"Error triggering Jenkins job '{job_name}': {e}")
        return False

if __name__ == "__main__":
    JENKINS_URL = "http://your-jenkins-instance.com"
    JENKINS_JOB_NAME = "MyDeploymentJob"
    JENKINS_USERNAME = "your_jenkins_user"
    JENKINS_API_TOKEN = "your_jenkins_api_token"

    # Example with parameters
    BUILD_PARAMS = {
        "BRANCH": "main",
        "ENVIRONMENT": "staging"
    }

    print(f"\n--- Triggering Jenkins Job: {JENKINS_JOB_NAME} ---")
    # Note: Replace with your actual Jenkins URL, job name, username, and API token.
    # Ensure Jenkins is accessible and API token has necessary permissions.
    # For a real scenario, you'd fetch JENKINS_API_TOKEN from environment variables or a secure vault.
    if trigger_jenkins_job(JENKINS_URL, JENKINS_JOB_NAME, JENKINS_USERNAME, JENKINS_API_TOKEN, BUILD_PARAMS):
        print("Jenkins job trigger command sent.")
    else:
        print("Failed to trigger Jenkins job.")
```

### Log Parsing and Analysis

Python's string manipulation capabilities, regular expressions, and file I/O make it excellent for parsing and analyzing log files, extracting critical information, and identifying patterns or anomalies.

**Example: Extracting Errors from a Log File**

This script reads a log file line by line and extracts lines containing specific error keywords, demonstrating basic log analysis.

```python
import re
import os

def analyze_log_for_errors(log_file_path, error_keywords=None):
    """Reads a log file and extracts lines containing specified error keywords."""
    if not os.path.exists(log_file_path):
        print(f"Error: Log file '{log_file_path}' not found.")
        return []

    if error_keywords is None:
        error_keywords = ["ERROR", "CRITICAL", "FAILED", "EXCEPTION"]

    found_errors = []
    # Create a regex pattern to match any of the keywords (case-insensitive)
    pattern = re.compile('|'.join(error_keywords), re.IGNORECASE)

    print(f"\n--- Analyzing log file: {log_file_path} ---")
    try:
        with open(log_file_path, 'r') as f:
            for line_num, line in enumerate(f, 1):
                if pattern.search(line):
                    found_errors.append(f"Line {line_num}: {line.strip()}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error reading log file: {e}")

    return found_errors

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Create a dummy log file for demonstration
    dummy_log_content = """
INFO: Application started.
DEBUG: Processing request for user 123.
ERROR: Database connection failed: Connection refused.
INFO: User 123 logged in.
WARNING: Disk space low on /dev/sda1.
CRITICAL: Unhandled exception in main loop: IndexError.
INFO: Task completed.
FAILED to send notification.
    """
    LOG_FILE = "app.log"
    with open(LOG_FILE, "w") as f:
        f.write(dummy_log_content)

    errors = analyze_log_for_errors(LOG_FILE)

    if errors:
        print("\n--- Detected Errors ---")
        for error in errors:
            print(error)
    else:
        print("No specified error keywords found in the log file.")

    os.remove(LOG_FILE)
```

### Automating System Administration Tasks

Python can streamline routine system administration tasks, from user management to service control and system health checks.

**Example: Managing Users (Linux/Unix-like systems)**

This script demonstrates how to add and remove users using `subprocess`. **Note:** These operations require appropriate permissions (e.g., `sudo`).

```python
import subprocess
import logging

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format=
    '%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s'
)

def run_command(command, description):
    """Helper to run shell commands and log output/errors."""
    try:
        logging.info(f"Executing: {description} ('{' '.join(command)}')")
        result = subprocess.run(command, capture_output=True, text=True, check=True)
        logging.info(f"Stdout: {result.stdout.strip()}")
        if result.stderr:
            logging.warning(f"Stderr: {result.stderr.strip()}")
        return True
    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
        logging.error(f"Failed to {description}. Command '{' '.join(command)}' exited with {e.returncode}. Stderr: {e.stderr.strip()}")
        return False
    except FileNotFoundError:
        logging.error(f"Command not found: {command[0]}. Is it in your PATH?")
        return False

def add_system_user(username, shell=
    '/bin/bash'
):
    """Adds a new system user."""
    # Example for Linux: useradd command
    # On some systems, you might need to add -m for home directory creation
    command = ["sudo", "useradd", "-s", shell, username]
    return run_command(command, f"add user {username}")

def remove_system_user(username, remove_home=False):
    """Removes a system user."""
    # Example for Linux: userdel command
    command = ["sudo", "userdel"]
    if remove_home:
        command.append("-r") # Remove home directory
    command.append(username)
    return run_command(command, f"remove user {username}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    NEW_USER = "devops_test_user"

    print(f"\n--- Attempting to add user: {NEW_USER} ---")
    if add_system_user(NEW_USER):
        print(f"User '{NEW_USER}' added. You might need to set a password manually or via another script.")
        # Example: Set password (less secure for automation, prefer SSH keys or other methods)
        # print(f"Setting password for {NEW_USER}...")
        # passwd_command = f"echo '{NEW_USER}:password123' | sudo chpasswd"
        # subprocess.run(passwd_command, shell=True, check=True)

        import time
        time.sleep(2)

        print(f"\n--- Attempting to remove user: {NEW_USER} ---")
        if remove_system_user(NEW_USER, remove_home=True):
            print(f"User '{NEW_USER}' removed successfully.")
        else:
            print(f"Failed to remove user '{NEW_USER}'.")
    else:
        print(f"Failed to add user '{NEW_USER}'.")
```

### Interacting with REST APIs of Various Tools

Many DevOps tools expose REST APIs for programmatic interaction. Python's `requests` library is perfect for this, allowing you to automate tasks in Jira, Jenkins, monitoring systems, and more.

**Example: Creating a Jira Issue**

This script demonstrates how to create a new issue in Jira using its REST API. This can be integrated into CI/CD pipelines to automatically create tickets for failed builds or deployments.

```python
import requests
import json
import logging

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format=
    '%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s'
)

def create_jira_issue(jira_url, username, api_token, project_key, summary, description, issue_type=
    'Task'
):
    """Creates a new Jira issue."""
    api_url = f"{jira_url}/rest/api/2/issue"
    headers = {
        "Accept": "application/json",
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
    }
    auth = (username, api_token)

    payload = json.dumps({
        "fields": {
            "project": {
                "key": project_key
            },
            "summary": summary,
            "description": description,
            "issuetype": {
                "name": issue_type
            }
        }
    })

    try:
        response = requests.post(api_url, headers=headers, auth=auth, data=payload)
        response.raise_for_status() # Raise an exception for HTTP errors
        issue_data = response.json()
        logging.info(f"Jira issue '{issue_data['key']}' created successfully: {jira_url}/browse/{issue_data['key']}")
        return issue_data
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        logging.error(f"Error creating Jira issue: {e}")
        if hasattr(e, 'response') and e.response is not None:
            logging.error(f"Jira API Response: {e.response.text}")
        return None

if __name__ == "__main__":
    JIRA_URL = "https://your-jira-instance.atlassian.net"
    JIRA_USERNAME = "your_jira_email"
    JIRA_API_TOKEN = "your_jira_api_token"
    JIRA_PROJECT_KEY = "DEV"
    ISSUE_SUMMARY = "Automated Issue: Failed Deployment on Staging"
    ISSUE_DESCRIPTION = "The deployment pipeline for service X failed at stage Y. Please investigate."

    print(f"\n--- Creating Jira Issue in project: {JIRA_PROJECT_KEY} ---")
    # Note: Replace with your actual Jira URL, username (email), API token, and project key.
    # Ensure the API token has permissions to create issues in the specified project.
    # For a real scenario, you'd fetch JIRA_API_TOKEN from environment variables or a secure vault.
    created_issue = create_jira_issue(
        JIRA_URL, JIRA_USERNAME, JIRA_API_TOKEN,
        JIRA_PROJECT_KEY, ISSUE_SUMMARY, ISSUE_DESCRIPTION
    )

    if created_issue:
        print(f"Jira issue created: {created_issue['key']}")
    else:
        print("Failed to create Jira issue.")
```

These examples illustrate just a fraction of what's possible with Python in DevOps. By combining these techniques, you can build sophisticated automation solutions tailored to your specific infrastructure and workflows.




## 4. Best Practices for DevOps Scripting

Writing effective DevOps scripts goes beyond just knowing the syntax and libraries. Adhering to best practices ensures your scripts are reliable, maintainable, secure, and scalable. This section outlines key considerations for building high-quality automation.

### Error Handling and Logging

As discussed in the Core Python Concepts section, robust error handling is paramount. In DevOps, a script failure can lead to outages, inconsistent environments, or missed deployments. Comprehensive logging provides visibility into script execution, aids in debugging, and helps in auditing.

*   **Graceful Error Handling:** Use `try-except` blocks extensively to catch anticipated errors (e.g., `FileNotFoundError`, `requests.exceptions.RequestException`, `boto3.client.exceptions.ClientError`). Provide informative error messages and, where possible, implement retry mechanisms for transient failures.

*   **Logging vs. Printing:** While `print()` is useful for quick debugging, `logging` is essential for production scripts. The `logging` module allows you to categorize messages (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL), direct output to files or remote systems, and control verbosity.

    ```python
    import logging
    import sys

    # Configure logging
    # Basic configuration: logs to console with INFO level and above
    logging.basicConfig(
        level=logging.INFO,
        format=
        '%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s'
        ,
        handlers=[
            logging.StreamHandler(sys.stdout) # Log to console
        ]
    )

    # To log to a file:
    # logging.basicConfig(
    #     level=logging.INFO,
    #     format=
    #     '%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s'
    #     ,
    #     handlers=[
    #         logging.FileHandler("devops_script.log"),
    #         logging.StreamHandler(sys.stdout)
    #     ]
    # )

    logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

    def process_data(data):
        logger.debug(f"Attempting to process data: {data}")
        if not data:
            logger.warning("Received empty data for processing.")
            return False
        try:
            result = 10 / int(data)
            logger.info(f"Successfully processed data. Result: {result}")
            return True
        except ValueError:
            logger.error(f"Invalid data type for processing: {data}. Expected a number.")
            return False
        except ZeroDivisionError:
            logger.critical("Attempted to divide by zero. This is a critical error!")
            return False
        except Exception as e:
            logger.exception(f"An unexpected error occurred during data processing: {e}") # Logs traceback
            return False

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        process_data("5")
        process_data("0")
        process_data("abc")
        process_data(None)
    ```

### Using Virtual Environments

Virtual environments are isolated Python environments that allow you to manage dependencies for different projects separately. This prevents conflicts between package versions and ensures that your scripts run with the exact dependencies they were developed with.

*   **Why use them?**
    *   **Dependency Isolation:** Avoids 


“dependency hell” where different projects require different versions of the same library.
    *   **Clean Project Setup:** Each project has its own `site-packages` directory, keeping your global Python installation clean.
    *   **Reproducibility:** Ensures that your script will run consistently across different machines and environments, as all dependencies are explicitly defined within the virtual environment.

*   **How to use `venv` (Python 3.3+ built-in module):**

    ```bash
    # 1. Create a virtual environment (e.g., named 'venv')
    python3 -m venv venv

    # 2. Activate the virtual environment
    # On Linux/macOS:
    source venv/bin/activate
    # On Windows (Command Prompt):
    # venv\Scripts\activate.bat
    # On Windows (PowerShell):
    # venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

    # 3. Install packages within the activated environment
    pip install requests boto3 PyYAML

    # 4. Deactivate the virtual environment when done
    deactivate
    ```

    When the virtual environment is activated, `pip` and `python` commands will refer to the executables within that environment. This ensures that any packages you install are isolated to that specific project.

### Command-Line Argument Parsing (`argparse`)

DevOps scripts often need to accept input from the command line (e.g., target environment, resource names, actions). The `argparse` module (built-in) makes it easy to write user-friendly command-line interfaces, handling argument parsing, help messages, and error handling.

```python
import argparse

### Writing Modular and Reusable Scripts

As your automation grows, it's crucial to organize your code into modular, reusable components. This improves readability, maintainability, and allows for easier testing and collaboration.

*   **Functions:** As seen in Core Concepts, functions are the primary way to encapsulate reusable logic.
*   **Modules and Packages:** Organize related functions and classes into separate `.py` files (modules). For larger projects, group related modules into packages (directories containing an `__init__.py` file).

    ```
    my_devops_project/
    ├── main.py
    ├── config/
    │   ├── __init__.py
    │   └── settings.py
    ├── cloud/
    │   ├── __init__.py
    │   ├── aws.py
    │   └── azure.py
    └── utils/
        ├── __init__.py
        └── helpers.py
    ```

    This structure allows you to `import` specific functionalities where needed:

    ```python
    # In main.py
    from cloud import aws
    from utils import helpers
    from config import settings

    # Use functions/variables from imported modules
    aws.start_ec2_instances(["i-123"]) # Example
    print(settings.APP_NAME)
    ```

### Security Considerations (e.g., handling credentials)

Security is paramount in DevOps. Scripts often handle sensitive information like API keys, passwords, and access tokens. Never hardcode credentials directly into your scripts.

*   **Environment Variables:** A common and relatively secure way to pass credentials to scripts. The script can read these variables at runtime.

    ```bash
    export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="YOUR_ACCESS_KEY"
    export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="YOUR_SECRET_KEY"
    # In your Python script:
    import os
    aws_access_key = os.getenv("AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID")
    ```

*   **Secret Management Services:** For production environments, use dedicated secret management services like AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, Google Secret Manager, HashiCorp Vault, or Kubernetes Secrets. These services provide secure storage, rotation, and access control for sensitive data.

*   **IAM Roles/Service Accounts:** When running scripts on cloud instances or within CI/CD pipelines, leverage IAM roles (AWS) or Service Accounts (Azure/GCP) instead of explicit credentials. This grants permissions to the compute resource itself, eliminating the need to store credentials on the instance.

*   **Least Privilege:** Always grant your scripts and the identities they run under the minimum necessary permissions to perform their tasks. Avoid using root or administrative privileges unless absolutely required.

*   **Input Validation:** Sanitize and validate all user inputs and external data to prevent injection attacks or unexpected behavior.

### Testing Your Scripts

Just like application code, DevOps scripts should be tested to ensure they function correctly and reliably. Testing helps catch bugs early, prevents regressions, and builds confidence in your automation.

*   **Unit Tests:** Test individual functions or small components in isolation. Python's built-in `unittest` module or the popular `pytest` framework are excellent choices.

    ```python
    # Example using pytest (install with: pip install pytest)
    # test_my_script.py

    # Assuming you have a function like this in your_script.py:
    # def add(a, b):
    #     return a + b

    # def test_add_function():
    #     assert add(1, 2) == 3
    #     assert add(-1, 1) == 0
    #     assert add(0, 0) == 0

    # To run tests: pytest
    ```

*   **Integration Tests:** Test how different components of your script interact with each other and with external systems (e.g., APIs, cloud services). For integration tests with external services, consider using mock objects to simulate responses and avoid making actual calls during testing.

*   **Idempotency:** Design your scripts to be idempotent, meaning that running them multiple times with the same inputs produces the same result as running them once. This is crucial for automation, as it allows for safe retries and prevents unintended side effects.

*   **Dry Runs:** Implement a `--dry-run` or similar flag in your scripts (as shown in the `argparse` example) that allows them to simulate actions without making actual changes. This is invaluable for testing and validating complex operations before execution in production.

By adopting these best practices, you can elevate your Python DevOps scripts from simple automation tools to robust, secure, and maintainable components of your infrastructure.
